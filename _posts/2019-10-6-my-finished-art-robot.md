## I created a robot which learns the same way that humans do (from influence) and documented the process of it creating a new piece of art.

Due date: 2nd of September, 2019. The acclimation of 8 months of work, an estimated 250 hours of complex coding, contemplation, mathematical modelling, construction, and management, produced something higher-valued than myself in the area designated “contemporary art”.

Modern art is abstract “value”, defined by being unconventional, unexpecting, undefined and dynamic. The artwork produced is of greater value than anything else I could possibly create physically.

### How it learnt

As I stated earlier, the robot's brain learnt in the same way of which traditional humans do. One could argue (which I will) that artists today use a much different inspection of reality compared to traditional artists, where I will place my creation in the former. Simply-put, my robot simply inspects the transactions which artists before it had made on a topic, and comes up with an appropriate plan to re-create by breaking down it's strokes, colours, and total-assortments.

One-third of the robot's brain is being able to look at something, and break it down into the perfect "brush strokes" to symbolize that artwork on it's own and give it a special identifier. For example, this methodology can be applied to periods of art such as impressionism, which idolized short and expressive colours to create scenery. Here are some examples:
